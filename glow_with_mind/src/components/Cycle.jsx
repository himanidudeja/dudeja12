          <h2>How to mannage stress!!!</h2>
          <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">

            There are countless techniques for managing stress. Yoga, mindfulness meditation, and exercise are just a few examples of stress-relieving activities that work wonders.
            But in the heat of the moment, during a high-pressured job interview, for example, or a disagreement with your spouse, you can’t just excuse yourself to meditate or take a long walk.
            In these situations, you need something more immediate and accessible.One of the speediest and most reliable ways to stamp out stress is to engage one or more of your senses—sight,
            sound, taste, smell, touch—or through movement. Since everyone is different, you’ll need to do some experimenting to discover which technique works best for you—but the payoff is huge. You can stay calm,
            productive, and focused when you know how to quickly relieve stress.Social interaction is your body’s most evolved and surefire strategy for regulating the nervous system.
            Talking face-to-face with a relaxed and caring listener can help you quickly calm down and release tension. Although you can’t always have a pal to lean on in the middle of a stressful situation,
            maintaining a network of close relationships is vital for your mental health. Between sensory-based stress relief and good listeners, you’ll have your bases covered.

            Anxiety is a common emotion when dealing with daily stresses and problems. But when these emotions are persistent,
            excessive and irrational, and affect a person's ability to function, anxiety becomes a disorder. There are different types of anxiety disorders,
            including phobias, panic and stress disorders, and obsessive compulsive disorder.
            Apprehension, confusion, on edge, a sense of helplessness, repeated negative thoughts, muscle tension, palpitations and difficulty breathing
            Simple strategies, such as relaxation techniques and regular exercise, are effective in reducing anxiety and contributing to emotional well-being. Psychotherapy can help and is sometimes used together with medication to reduce and eliminate signs and symptoms.

            Depression is a low mood that lasts for a long time, affecting everyday life. It is often triggered by a mix of genetic,
            psychological and environmental factors; studies show that the risk of becoming depressed can be increased by life events
            such as poverty, death of a loved one, physical illness or abuse. For some, the risk is also hereditary.Persistent sadness,
            loss of interest in activities, loss of appetite, feelings of worthlessness, becoming easily agitated, among others Talk therapy
            with a trained counsellor or psychotherapist, exercise and support groups are among the options available. Antidepressants are also
            sometimes prescribed, but they should not be used for treating children, and should not be the first line of treatment for adolescents.
            All treatment should involve identifying stress factors and sources of support, and individuals should maintain social networks and activities.

          <h2>How To Overcome Anger</h2>
          <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Anger is “an emotional state that varies in intensity from mild irritation to intense fury and rage,” according to Charles Spielberger,
            PhD, a psychologist who specializes in the study of anger. Like other emotions, it is accompanied by physiological and biological change
            when you get angry, your heart rate and blood pressure go up, as do the levels of your energy hormones, adrenaline, and noradrenaline.
            Anger can be caused by both external and internal events. You could be angry at a specific person (such as a coworker or supervisor) or event
            (a traffic jam, a canceled flight), or your anger could be caused by worrying or brooding about your personal problems. Memories of traumatic
            or enraging events can also trigger angry feelings.
            <br />
            <b>FOUR REASONS (CAUSES) FOR ANGER:-</b>
            <br />
            <b>BEING OVERACTIVE</b>
            This means you have too much going on at once. You have overbooked and  overscheduled yourself and your family. The result is you are overly time conscious. Any delay makes you irritable and angry.
            <br />
            <b>EGO</b>
            If anyone says anything negative to you, your ego is hurt. You can’t handle any kind of criticism and you want to get even with that person.
            <br /><b>
              EXPECTATIONS</b>
            If you keep expectations and they are not fulfilled, you get angry. We must accept the fact that all of us have weaknesses. Accept the weaknesses of others and adjust to them. If you don’t, you are just setting yourself up for disappointment, which in turn will lead to anger.
            <br />
            <b>A NEGATIVE APPROACH</b>
            It is often said – What you think is what you are. What you think will happen, will probably happen. So don’t be negative in your thinking. Instead, be positive. Take a positive approach if something bad happens. For example, if you are making dal, and the salt is too little, don’t say “Oh No! There is less salt!” Instead say “Salt was just fine, dal became a little more.”

          <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            A delusion is a fixed false belief based on an inaccurate interpretation of an external reality despite evidence to the contrary.
            The diagnosis of a delusional disorder is made when a person has one or more non-bizarre (situations that are not real but also not impossible)
            delusional thoughts for one month or more that cannot be explained by any other condition. An individual's cultural beliefs merit consideration before coming
            to the diagnosis. Cultural beliefs also impact the content of delusions. In patients with delusional disorder, delusions(s) do not impact the functionality and
            the patient's behavior is not overtly bizarre.This activity reviews the evaluation and management of delusional disorder and highlights the role of the interprofessional
            team in caring for affected patients.

          <h2>You are more than a number. Nourish, heal, thrive.</h2>
          <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            If you have an eating disorder, you may believe that if you can control
            what you eat, you’ll be able to control your life. But true confidence comes
            from accepting yourself for who you truly are—and that’s only possible with recovery.
            All of us eat too much from time to time. But if you regularly overeat while feeling out of control and powerless to stop,
            you may be suffering from binge eating disorder. Binge eating disorder is a common eating disorder where you frequently eat large
            amounts of food while feeling powerless to stop and extremely distressed during or after eating. You may eat to the point of discomfort,
            then be plagued by feelings of guilt, shame, or depression afterwards, beat yourself up for your lack of self-control, or worry about what
            compulsive eating will do to your body.Binge eating disorder typically begins in late adolescence or early adulthood, often after a major diet.
            During a binge, you may eat even when you’re not hungry and continue eating long after you’re full. You may also binge so fast you barely register
            what you’re eating or tasting. Unlike bulimia, however, there are no regular attempts to “make up” for the binges through vomiting, fasting, or over-exercising.
            You may find that binge eating is comforting for a brief moment, helping to ease unpleasant emotions or feelings of stress, depression, or anxiety.
            But then reality sets back in and you’re flooded with feelings of regret and self-loathing. Binge eating often leads to weight gain and obesity, which
            only reinforces compulsive eating. The worse you feel about yourself and your appearance, the more you use food to cope. It becomes a vicious cycle: eating to feel better,
            feeling even worse, and then turning back to food for relief. As powerless as you may feel about your eating disorder, it’s important to know that binge eating disorder is treatable.
            You can learn to break the binge eating cycle, better manage your emotions,
            develop a healthier relationship with food, and regain control over your eating and your health.

          Sleep disorder is a health problem that affects a person's ability to sleep well regularly. Many people face trouble sleeping due to stress, anxiety, depression, or an unhealthy lifestyle. There are different types of sleep disorders like insomnia (difficulty in sleeping), sleep apnea (breathing problems during sleep), restless legs syndrome, and narcolepsy (excessive daytime sleepiness). People suffering from sleep disorders may feel tired, weak, or irritated throughout the day. Lack of proper sleep can affect concentration, mood, and overall health. It is very important to follow healthy sleeping habits like sleeping on time, avoiding caffeine at night, reducing screen time before bed, and practicing relaxation techniques. If sleep problems continue for a long time, it is necessary to consult a doctor for treatment and guidance.
